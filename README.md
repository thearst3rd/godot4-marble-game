# Godot 4 Marble Game

This is a test marble game that I'm working on in [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) 4.1.

The gameplay and physics are inspired by the Marble Blast series, including the intentional inclusion of diagonal movement (pressing two diagonal keys like W+A or W+D makes you move ~1.414x as fast). I'm not aiming to replicate the physics entirely, but it's one of my favorite marble games and I wanted to make something that emulates it.
