# Godot 4 Marble Game

This is a test marble game that I'm working on in [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/). I'm using the 4.0 alpha, currently [alpha 14](https://godotengine.org/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-0-alpha-14) to do this project, partially because I wanted to check out some of the new features in 4.0 and partially because I want to learn more about it and maybe report some bugs.

The physics are inspired by the Marble Blast series, including the intentional inclusion of diagonal movement (pressed W+A or W+D makes you move ~1.414x as fast). I'm not aiming to replicate the physics entirely, but it's one of my favorite marble games and I wanted to make something that emulates it.

Feel free to use this project as a base for your own marble game! The code is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE). In the current state of this repository, there really isn't much in the way of assets, particularly there are no levels currently. So feel free to take what you want. Once I start adding levels, maybe I'll make a more precise license for the assets.
