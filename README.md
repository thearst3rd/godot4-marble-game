# Godot 4 Marble Game

This is a test marble game that I'm working on in [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/). I'm using the 4.0 alpha, currently [alpha 15](https://godotengine.org/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-0-alpha-15) to do this project, partially because I wanted to check out some of the new features in 4.0 and partially because I want to learn more about it and maybe report some bugs.

The gameplay and physics are inspired by the Marble Blast series, including the intentional inclusion of diagonal movement (pressing two diagonal keys like W+A or W+D makes you move ~1.414x as fast). I'm not aiming to replicate the physics entirely, but it's one of my favorite marble games and I wanted to make something that emulates it.
